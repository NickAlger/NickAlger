Dm_Island17 was made for the 2004/2005 Valve Half-Life 2: Deathmatch mapping contest that coincided with the launch of Half-Life 2. Contest rules required that the map use only stock content (textures, models, etc). The map is set on Island17, an island off the coast of City 17. Expect lots of vertical combat.
