The [Astroknot puzzle](http://puzzlesolver.com/puzzle.php?id=45) is one of the most difficult wire-and-string tanglement puzzles I’ve found. This page explains how to solve it, and in the process some general ideas about solving tanglement/topology-ladder puzzles. Here’s a picture of the puzzle; the goal is to remove the string.
